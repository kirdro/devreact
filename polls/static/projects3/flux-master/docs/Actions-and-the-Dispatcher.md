This guide originally appeared as a [post](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/07/30/flux-actions-and-the-dispatcher.html) on the [React blog](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/), and has been edited and updated for inclusion here.


The Dispatcher
--------------

The ___dispatcher___ is a singleton, and operates as the central hub of data flow in a Flux application. It is essentially a registry of callbacks, and can invoke these callbacks in order. Each ___store___ registers a callback with the ___dispatcher___. When new data comes into the ___dispatcher___, it then uses these callbacks to propagate that data to all of the ___stores___. The process of invoking the callbacks is initiated through the `dispatch()` method, which takes a data payload object as its sole argument. This payload is typically synonymous with an ___action___.

Actions and Action Creators
---------------------------

When new data enters the system, whether through a person interacting with the application or through a web api call, that data is packaged into an ___action___ â€” an object literal containing the new fields of data and a specific action type. We often create a library of helper methods called ___action creators___ that not only create the action object, but also pass the ___action___ to the ___dispatcher___.

Different ___actions___ are identified by a type attribute. When all of the ___stores___ receive the ___action___, they typically use this attribute to determine if and how they should respond to it. In a Flux application, both ___stores___ and ___views___ control themselves; they are not acted upon by external objects. ___Actions___ flow into the ___stores___ through the callbacks they define and register, not through setter methods.

Letting the ___stores___ update themselves eliminates many entanglements typically found in MVC applications, where cascading updates between models can lead to unstable state and make accurate testing very difficult. The objects within a Flux application are highly decoupled, and adhere very strongly to the [Law of Demeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter), the principle that each object within a system should know as little as possible about the other objects in the system. This results in software that is more maintainable, adaptable, testable, and easier for new engineering team members to understand.


Why We Need a Dispatcher
------------------------

As an application grows, dependencies across different ___stores___ are a near certainty. ___Store___ A will inevitably need Store B to update itself first, so that Store A can know how to update itself. We need the ___dispatcher___ to be able to invoke the callback for Store B, and finish that callback, before moving forward with Store A. To declaratively assert this dependency, a ___store___ needs to be able to say to the ___dispatcher___, "I need to wait for Store B to finish processing this action." The ___dispatcher___ provides this functionality through its `waitFor()` method.

The `dispatch()` method provides a simple, synchronous iteration through the callbacks, invoking each in turn. When `waitFor()` is encountered within one of the callbacks, execution of that callback stops and `waitFor()` provides us with a new iteration cycle over the dependencies. After the entire set of dependencies have been fulfilled, the original callback then continues to execute.

Further, the `waitFor()` method may be used in different ways for different ___actions___, within the same ___store___'s callback.  In one case, Store A might need to wait for Store B.  But in another case, it might need to wait for Store C.  Using `waitFor()` within the code block that is specific to an ___action___ allows us to have fine-grained control of these dependencies.

Problems arise, however, if we have circular dependencies. That is, if Store A needs to wait for Store B, and Store B needs to wait for Store A, we could wind up in an endless loop. The ___dispatcher___ now available in the Flux repo protects against this by throwing an informative error to alert the developer that this problem has occurred. The developer can then create a third ___store___ and resolve the circular dependency.
